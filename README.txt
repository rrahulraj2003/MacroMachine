Update log:
9/21/2022 - If you're seeing this, welcome! Today marks the day of the 
glorious victory of MacroMaster, now in V1. The trash button is not 
functioning but, for the most part, the program records and plays 
mouse clicks, drags, keyboard press, and scroll (with a mouse).
Side note: learn what the keyword static really does, or it will wreak
havoc and waste hours of your time trying figure out why a parameter 
variable for one object changed when a new object was created. :)
