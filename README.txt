What's a macro? Well, a macro is an action that sequence of mouse clicks
and keyboard presses that a computer can mimic. If you want your computer
to go to chrome and login on gmail for you, a macro can do just that!
Macromaster records your mouse and keyboard actions and then play the
macro for you!

Update log:
9/21/2022 - If you're seeing this, welcome! Today marks the day of the 
glorious victory of MacroMaster, now in V1. The delete button is not 
functioning but, for the most part, the program records and plays 
mouse clicks, drags, keyboard press, and scroll (with a mouse).

9/23/22 - Delete button still doesn't work but recording and playing
were optimized and work phenomenally. Great progress. Macro Master V2 
is smooth like butter. B)
