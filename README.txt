Update log:
9/21/2022 - If you're seeing this, welcome! Today marks the day of the 
glorious victory of MacroMaster, now in V1. The delete button is not 
functioning but, for the most part, the program records and plays 
mouse clicks, drags, keyboard press, and scroll (with a mouse).
Side note: learn what the keyword static or your objects will not
function as intended :)

9/23/22 - I had homework and I was tired yesterday so I didn't do
anything. Delete button still doesn't work but recording and playing
were improved and work phenomenally. Great progress. Macro Master V2 
is smooth like butter. B)
